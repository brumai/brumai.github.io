# Mission
We're working to become the home of AI in the midlands. 
We believe that AI represents the most impactful technological shift humankind has ever seen, and we want to make sure that it is used for good. To this end, we're doing three things:
* Fostering entrepreneurship by supporting startups that use AI for good [coming soon]
* Helping developers to get started in AI 
* Bringing the region's researchers, industry, developers and founders together

# Attend a Meetup
We meet at least once a month (usually more).
Check out our schedule on <http://meetup.com/brum-ai>

# How to volunteer
BrumAI is run entirely by volunteers for free. We think Birmingham can become the UK city of choice to start an AI startup and we think that's well worth volunteering for. If you'd like to muck in and help make a big impact contact Peet through the [Meetup Site](https://meetup.com/brum-ai)
