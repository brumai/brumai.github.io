# Mission
We're working to become the home of AI in the midlands. 
We believe that AI represents the most impactful technological shift humankind has ever seen, and we want to make sure that it is used for good. To this end, we're doing three things
* Fostering entrepreneurship by supporting startups that use AI for good [coming soon]
* Helping developers to get started in AI 
* Bringing the regions researchers, industry, developers and founders together

# Our sick content
* YouTube
* Github
* Slack
* Podcast (coming soon!)
